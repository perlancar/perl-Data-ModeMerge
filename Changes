0.35    2016-07-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - No functional changes.

        - Re-release to get indexed on PAUSE, because I accidentally uploaded
          Bencher-Scenarios-DataModeMerge-0.001.tar.gz which contains archive/
          with Data::ModeMerge 0.34 inside, making PAUSE indexing that instance
          instead.


0.34    2016-07-19  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Delay load Data::Dmp to reduce startup overhead.


0.33    2016-02-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Replace Data::Dumper with Data::Dmp.


0.32    2015-02-21  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

        - Delay loading Data::Dumper and Data::ModeMerge::Config to further
          reduce startup overhead.


0.31    2015-02-21  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Switch from Moo to Mo to reduce startup overhead.


0.30    2013-07-16  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - No functional changes. Replace indirect call to avoid warning from
         'indirect'.


0.29   2012-12-13  Released-By: SHARYANTO; Note: Thank God the apocalypse did not happen, allowing me to do this release.

        - Fix cloning bug exposed by hash randomization of perl 5.17.6
          [RT#81807]. Turns out Data::Clone does not deep-copy objects by
          default. So now we copy configs manually.


0.28    2012-11-30  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Replace Clone::Any with Data::Clone (Clone::Any fallbacks to Storable
          which doesnt support storing Regexp)

        - Add missing dependency to Test::Exception [RT#81544]


0.27    2011-02-24  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - regression: Clone needed as dependency


0.26    2011-02-23  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - switch from Mouse to Moo


0.25    2010-11-10  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - add use 5.010 instead of use feature (5.8.x doesn't have this yet)


0.24    2010-07-23  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - switch from Clone to Clone::Any  Released-By: but still list Clone as dep


0.23   2010-02-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

       - switch from Moose to Any::Moose (+Mouse as dependency)


0.22    2009-12-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - some work on doc

        - minor fixes


0.21    2009-12-15  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - replace Storable + Regexp::Copy with Clone


0.20    2009-12-15  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - use Regexp::Copy


0.19    2009-12-14  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - fix copy-paste bug


0.18    2009-12-12  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - bug fix: custom prefix_re got reset in hash merge

        - bug fix: restore_config() didn't recreate DM::Config object but hash
          instead


0.17    2009-12-12  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - INCOMPATIBLE BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: SUBTRACT merge on two hashes is now
          defined as a NORMAL merge, except that all keys on the right-side hash
          which do not have a merge prefix will be assumed to have a DELETE
          prefix. This means the SUBTRACT mode can now grok mode prefix and
          options key too.

        - INCOMPATIBLE BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: merging hash keys with DELETE mode now
          will make the key disappear even if there is no corresponding left or
          right side. merge({}, {"!a"=>1}) and merge({"!a"=>1}, {}) used to be
          {"!a"=>1} but now will be {}. I believe this is more
          intuitive/expected.


0.16    2009-12-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - some work on doc


0.15    2009-12-11  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - new config; premerge_pair_filter

        - NORMAL mode can handle CODE refs

        - can merge recursive/circular references  Released-By: though not all possible cases


0.14    2009-12-07  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Minor fix to Makefile.PL

        - Minor fix to options key handling


0.13    2009-12-07  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - This is a major refactoring of the module. The goal is to make the
          code more flexible (e.g. adding future modes, changing prefix for each
          mode, etc). Configuration is also significantly expanded.

        - rename dist: Data-PrefixMerge -> Data-ModeMerge (to reflect the fact
          that merging mode can be selected not only via a "prefix" but more
          generally by a regex test on key).

        - incompatible behaviour: all hash prefixes on the left-side and
          right-side hash will be removed recursively after merge, even if it is
          not a hash-hash merge, e.g. mode_merge({a=>1}, {b=>{"+c"=>1}) used to
          become {a=>1, b=>{"+c"=>1}} but now it will become {a=>1, b=>{c=>1}}.
          this ensures that all prefixes are "cleaned" after merge.

        - incompatible behaviour: KEEP prefix (^) is now always sticky so it
          always protects future merges (equivalent to old config's
          preserve_keep_prefix). If you want KEEP prefix to be removed after
          merge, set config C<readd_prefix> to 0.

        - incompatible change: options key is now enabled by default, with ""
          (empty string) as the key.

        - incompatible change: configuration 'parse_hash_key_prefix' renamed to
          'parse_prefix'.

        - removed: remove_keep_prefix(), replaced by the more generic
          remove_prefix().

        - configurable prefix for each merging mode.

        - new config: set_prefix allows you to change prefixes, even in the
          middle of recursive merge.

        - new config: allow_override & disallow_override.

        - new config: allow_create_array, allow_create_hash,
          allow_destroy_array, allow_destroy_hash.

        - new config: exclude_parse, exclude_parse_regex, include_parse,
          include_parse_regex.

        - new config: exclude_merge, exclude_merge_regex, include_merge,
          include_merge_regex.

        - new config: disable_modes. each merging mode can now be individually
          enabled/disabled through configuration.

        - options key now understands almost all configuration.


0.12    2009-11-25  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - new option: hash_options_key

        - fixed random ordering bug (closes #51799)


0.11    2009-11-23  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - add max_level parameter to remove_keep_prefixes()


0.10    2009-11-23  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - handle recursion in remove_keep_prefixes()


0.09    2009-11-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - fix bug in remove_keep_prefixes()


0.08    2009-11-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - new method: remove_keep_prefixes()


0.07    2009-11-18  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - minor fixes


0.06    2009-11-08  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: getting and setting config is now done via
          $merger->config->confname instead of $merger->config->{confname} to
          catch config name typos at compile time.


0.05    2009-06-22  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - yet another incompatible change: keep prefix now uses '^' instead of
          '!' on the left side. this allows keep mode on the right side. on a
          series of merge we can now introduce keep mode at one point (not just
          on the first hash) and then preserve that keep mode afterwards.


0.04    2009-06-17  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - support KEEP merge for hash & hash


0.03    2009-06-12  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - incompatible change: '*' prefix on the left now means normal merge
          mode (to protect hash keys having special characters). keep mode now
          uses '!' on the left side.

        - add config: preserve_prefix (default is 0).


0.02    2009-03-30  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - Rename Data-RecMerge to Data-PrefixMerge.


0.01    2009-03-29  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        - First release.
